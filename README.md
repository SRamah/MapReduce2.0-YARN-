# MapReduce2.0-YARN-
As part of the recent release of Hadoop 2 by the Apache Software Foundation, YARN and MapReduce 2 deliver significant upgrades to scheduling, resource management, and execution in Hadoop.   At their core, YARN and MapReduce 2â€™s improvements separate cluster resource management capabilities from MapReduce-specific logic. YARN enables Hadoop to share resources dynamically between multiple parallel processing frameworks such as Cloudera Impala, allows more sensible and finer-grained resource configuration for better cluster utilization, and scales Hadoop to accommodate more and larger jobs.
